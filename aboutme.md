I'm a french engineer with a  Ph.D in computer science.
I'm interested in lot of fields of computer science, mostly about computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning and database/big data.

My [Ph.D](https://github.com/Remi-C/inverse_procedural_street_modelling) was about inverse procedural street modelling, and was divided in roughly three parts : one part to generate/edit a street model in database ([streetgen](http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/II-3-W5/409/2015/isprsannals-II-3-W5-409-2015.pdf) ([videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn4KJ6gBgPuVQV3suF4QbjQ)), using postgres/postgis), one part to deal with massive point cloud in database ([point cloud server](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092427161630123X), [implicit Level Of Detail](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06920)), and one optimisation part to fit a street model to observations extracted from mobile mapping street images/point cloud.

I like [to travel](http://www.laruevibre.org/) and gourmet food/drinks.
I also like manual craft, such as leather craft and [wood working](http://remi-c.github.io/ultra_molkky/).
