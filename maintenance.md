Detailed maintaining

Like everything that is wooden , 
the cutting board fears only prolongated contact with water and/or steam! 
The main idea is to __never let the wooden board soak in water__.


[Maintenance, DO and DON'T](http://remi.cura.info/ultimately_functional_cutting_board/img/maintaining/maintaining_do_dont.png)


What to do the first time you get the board: 


 - generously oil it with olive oil or other edible oil, __untill it is saturated__ (oil don't enter the board anymore).
 - You can leave the oil on the board overnight
 - You can slightly warm the oil so it penetrates better the wood.  


Once every few months :


 - put some oil on the board (light oiling) qnd let it penetrate overnight

 
Everyday use : 


 - Clean it as you clean anything else (manually). Let water run on it from you tap, then use your usual dishwashing soap, your regular spong/scrub sponge if you want. 
 - roughly wimp it to remove excess water if you can, or simply shake it once or twice
 - let it rest on the side, where the water will further evaporates.
  
  

What __not__ to do : 


 - put the cutting board in the dishwasher. 
  * This is dangerous for the board, it may twist/crack, and become permanently curved.
  * Your board is not available untill the dishwasher is launched and finished.
  * And you don't gain any time : The time to put the board in and out the dishwasher is about the same as the time for a fast sponge cleaning.
 - let the cutting board soak in water (for instance in your kitchen sink)

 
What you could try :


 - use your cutting board as a trivet (table mat)
