# Main Design choices
This board is the results of a very careful design.
> This board is designed to provide maximum functionnality.

Here is a schema of board design choices and the advantages that they provides.

# vs traditional cutting board
Traditionnal cutting boards all have limitations.
The board we propose overcome these limitations, at the cost of incrased required building work.

# Details and notes
## 100% solid wood
### Wood action on bactery

Several scientific studies, such as [this one](http://jfoodprotection.org/doi/abs/10.4315/0362-028X-57.1.16) found that for cutting boards, wooden is better than plastic or marble regarding bacteria.

The reason is that while marble and plastic cutting boards contains micro-grooves that are extremely difficult to clean.
In the opposite,
> wood cutting boards absorb and kill bacteria.

### Wood rigidity
> At egual weight, wood is more rigid than steel!

## End grain wood
### End grain is Hard !
> End grain is typically 50% more resistant to impact than along the grain wood (Brinell test).

### End grain is more stable
> the radial deformation is about half the amount of the tangential deformation.
Futhermore the change in length is negligible, therefore not compromising the board flatness.

## Selected wood species
### Resistance to water
> All selected wood species are famous for resisting to water and age extremely well.
### Local wood
>Wood is mainly local (robinia, castanea), teck is from managed forest
### Robinia, the main species, is not easy to find and very hard to work with.
> Robinia is about 30% stiffer and about 35% harder than oak!

## Efficient shape
### Simple
> The rectangel shapes facilitates storage in drawer, with the cutting board being on the edge
### Combined
>The integrated handle design is very efficient
### Two sided
> Having two sides is essential. One without grooves maximize surface, the other is esthetic and practical.

## Advanced structure
### Tongue-renforced
> Like reinforced concrete, the board is much stiffer and more cohesive.

> The tongues add a lot of work and complexify building a lot.
### Frame
> The frame is made of castanea (chestnut), which absorb well shocks, increasing the resiliency of board in case of drop
> Castanea has been extensively used for barrel building.
### Specific glue
> The Titebond 3 glue is perfect for cutting board, but very expensive (5 to 10 x more expensive that classical glue).
> To our knowledge, there is no "natural" glue that resists water and is edible.
